# osproject6

This is a custom file system project I worked on in my Operating Systems class.
It operates very similar to the Unix inode layer and works using a disk emulator.
It makes use of knowledge of the following principles:
- Super blocks
- Inode blocks
- Direct and indirect data blocks
- Mounted and unmounted file systems
- Valid and invalid inodes
- and much more!

It is all written in C and is operational
